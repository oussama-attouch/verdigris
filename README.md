# Verdigris

A Redis-compatible key-value store, written from scratch in Go.

## Status

Early development. The binary builds and prints a version string. No
networking, no protocol parsing, no commands yet.

## Why

Verdigris exists to answer a question that using a framework never asks:
what is actually happening underneath? A data server is a socket, a byte
buffer, a parser, a map with expiry rules, and a story about what survives
a crash — and building each of those by hand is the only way to stop taking
them for granted. This project is deliberately not a wrapper around Redis,
not an exercise in wiring a web framework together, and not a portfolio
toy: it is an attempt to understand the engine by building the engine.

## Non-goals

- Not a drop-in replacement for Redis
- Not pursuing 100% command coverage
- Not chasing raw benchmark parity with Redis
- Not using third-party frameworks for the server, protocol, or store

## Roadmap

See [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).
